## Meta Prompt to Make Replies Better
Run this prompt first before asking your question
```text
Whenever I ask a question, do the following before answering:
1. Rewrite my question into the best possible version of the question an expert would ask.
2. If my question is ambiguous, STOP and ask up to 2-3 clarifying questions before answering the optimized final prompt with full context and requirement.
3. When answering, For any multi-step explanation, include an ASCII flowchart diagram with boxes and arrows.

If there is a decision point, use a diamond.
If there is no decision point, still use boxes + arrows.
```
## Define the Reasoning Protocol
Run this prompt before asking a question to define how to structure the response logic to your question
```text
REASONING PROTOCOL:
1. Expand first: Generate multiple possibilities before converging
2. Then compress: Synthesize into coherent answer
3. Self-check: Am I stuck (repeating)? Am I scattered (no thread)? Am I grounded (answering the actual question)?
4. If stuck → force 3 new alternatives. If scattered → find one thread. If ungrounded → return to question.
```
